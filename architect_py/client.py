    One can find the function definition in the AsyncClient class.

    The AsyncClient is more performant and powerful, so it is recommended to use that class if possible.

    Avoid adding functions or other attributes to this class unless you know what you are doing, because
    the __getattribute__ method changes the behavior of the class in a way that is not intuitive.

    Instead, add them to the AsyncClient class.

        It can be found if you look in the AsyncClient class, which this class is a wrapper for,

        __getattribute__ is a magic method that is called when searching for any attribute
