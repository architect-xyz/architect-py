## Example usage

```python
import asyncio
from architect_py.async_client import AsyncClient


async def main():
    c = AsyncClient(
        host="<your installation domain>",
        api_key="<api key>",
        api_secret="<api secret>"
    )
    print(await c.execute("query { me { userId email } }"))
    s = c.subscribe_trades("BTC Crypto/USD*COINBASE/DIRECT")
    async for trade in s:

## Running additional examples from this package

Clone this repository to run examples in the `examples` directory.  This package
uses poetry for dependency management.  To enter a poetry virtual environment, make
sure you have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) installed and run the 
following from the repository root.

```bash
poetry shell
poetry install --sync 

export ARCHITECT_HOST="<your installation domain>"
export ARCHITECT_API_KEY="<api key>"
export ARCHITECT_API_SECRET="<api secret>"

python -m examples.trades
```

You can exit the poetry shell by running `exit`.  Environment variables set
within the shell are not persisted.

## Maintainers

On any update, please run `update.sh`
In addition, any new function should have a test included in test.py

To run tests:
`export $(cat pytest.env | xargs)`
`pytest tests/*`


How to generate the types:
`poetry run ariadne-codegen --config ariadne-codegen.toml`

Python type conversions for scalars should be added to the codegen toml files, if needed.

- `schema.graphql`: autogenerated from `architect-gql schema`
- `queries.graphql`: add any new queries/mutations
- `queries.async.graphql`: add any new async queries/mutations/subscriptions
