# Maintainers

Python type conversions for scalars should be added to the codegen toml files, if needed.

Important files:
- `scripts/update_schema`: the code autogen that creates: the sync client stubs, grpc types, graphql queries, and corrects formatting.
- `schema.graphql`: autogenerated from `architect-gql schema`
- `queries.graphql`: add any new queries/mutations. Currently mostly used for symbology requests. Will be phased out eventually.
- `architect_py/async_client.py`: inherits from the ariadne generated base client
- `architect_py/client.py`: contains the sync client, delegates functions calls to a composed AsyncClient in the innards, inherits from the client_protocol to give the correct type hinting from Pylance
- `tests` and `examples`: self-explanatory

In addition, any new function should have a test included in test.py

To run tests:
`uv run pytest`

## Type Linting

We want ZERO Pyright/Pylance errors.
One important note: occassionally, Pylance will throw a fake error. To remove the error, just delete one letter in the error and then add it back.
This is generally on the Unannotated types.


## Extra Packages Used In Update Schema

- datamodel-codegen: used for generating the grpc classes
- mypy stubgen: used to generate the sync client stubs
