## v0.1.0 | Initial Release

Introducing Architectâ€™s JavaScript SDK.

This initial release enables you to build apps with a core subset of our API
capabilities.

There are two core ways to use the SDK at this time:

* Core SDK interface
* Raw GraphQL queries

The core SDK interface is the recommended path, however it does not offer 1:1
capabilities with the GraphQL API yet so there are some scenarios that can only
be exercised through the GraphQL API at this time.
